# Speech Emotion Detection built using Conv1D+LSTM layers
This is a user-driven speech emotion detection system.
#### Tech Stack:
*   TensorFlow
*   libROSA
*   PyAudio

There are 3 things which can be done:
1. Train the model again (This will take time, on a GeForce GTX 1650 GPU, training took around 1 hour)
2. Randomly select sample voices and test the model on actual and predicted values
3. Test the model on your own voice sample


## Limitations:
*   "Emotions" are hard to annotate, even for humans. There is no "Perfect" dataset for such problem.
